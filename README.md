# Network Emulation Framework for Industrial Control Systems (NEFICS)

Bruh, I just copied the files from multiple projects that had dependencies and corrected some stuff that was wrong with the imports.
Maybe I'm stoopid, but those imports looked like this script was written in a single evening. But I'm not a Python programmer, so I can't judge. Still, they were junk.
